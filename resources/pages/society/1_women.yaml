        <p>I trust that not another Federal election will take place without there
        being a woman endorsed as a Labour candidate for the Senate and I hope
        that it will not be only in one State.</p>
        <small>Prime Minister <a href="/s/p/F4N">Andrew Fisher</a> in
        <a href="http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/fisher/before-office.aspx#section6">a speech to the 1908 Labor Conference</a></small>

    In 1943 Australia's first female Senator and Member were elected,
    <a href="/s/p/K7Y">Dame Dorothy Tagney</a> and <a href="/s/p/J7U">Dame Enid Lyons</a>
    respectfully. Since 1943 Australia has always had a sitting female Senator,
    with Dame Tangney soon followed after by <a href="/s/p/K28">Annabelle Rankin</a> in 1947.
    </p>
    <p>
    In 1946 Australia's second female Member, <a href="/s/p/JPL">Doris Blackburn</a>, was elected.
    However, following her defeat in 1949 and Dame Lyons retirement in 1951 it
    would be a further 15 years before a female Member, <a href="/s/p/JSO">Kay Brownbill</a>,
    would rejoin the House of Representatives.
    </p>
    <p>
    In 1976 Prime Minister
    <a href="/s/p/QS4">Malcolm Fraser</a> appointed <a href="/s/p/KVM">Anthony Street</a>
    the first <a href="/tables/explorer?lead_suspect=parlhand%3APerson&filter_by=ministerialappointment.position.label__contains%3Dwomen&filter_by=&columns=name&columns=ministerialappointment.position.label&columns=ministerialappointment.start_date&columns=&sort_by=ministerialappointment.start_date&sort_by=&action=">Minister in charge of Women's Affairs</a>,
    and in 1983 <a href="/s/p/GD5">Susan Ryan</a> was the first woman appointed to this
    role, with many following since.
    </p>
    <p>In 2007 <a href="/s/p/83L">Julia Gillard</a> became the first female Deputy Prime Minister
    before becoming Australia's first female Prime Minister in the
