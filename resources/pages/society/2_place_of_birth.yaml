    <blockquote>
        <p>A good quote about origins</p>
        <small>Prime Minister <a href="/s/p/F4N">Andrew Fisher</a> in
        <a href="http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/primeministers/fisher/before-office.aspx#section6">a speech to the 1908 Labor Conference</a></small>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    While in modern times most parliamentarians have been born on Australian soil, 
    in the early colonial and federation eras many were born in England or its colonies.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    However, far from being of solely British origins Australian representatives have
    also come from far abroad across the Pacific, with former Prime Minister
    <a href="/s/p/F4R">Chris Watson</a> being born in Chile, and Canberra character
    <a href="/s/p/">King O'Malley</a> born in Canada (or the United States of America depending on
    the version of the story you prefer).
