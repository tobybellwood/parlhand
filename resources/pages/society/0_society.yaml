        <p>When government makes opportunities for any of the citizens, it makes
        them for all the citizens.
        We are all diminished as citizens when any of us are poor.
        Poverty is a national waste as well as individual waste.
        We are all diminished when any of us are denied proper education.
        The nation is the poorer â€“ a poorer economy, a poorer civilisation,
        because of this human and national waste.</p>
